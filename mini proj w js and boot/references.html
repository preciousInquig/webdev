        UPDATE OF THE WEBSITE USING JS AND BOOTSTRAP (OCT 29):
        <ol>
          <P>
            Hi! For my additional update, I enhanced the website by incorporating JavaScript and Bootstrap to improve interactivity and responsiveness.
            I tried to use easy animations like fade-ins using bootstrap and AOS links. I duplicated the same CSS styles to all my artcles. 
            I plan to do more complex features in the next activity.
