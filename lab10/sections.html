    <h2>First impression</h2>
    <p>most ppl's first impression of me is not approachable, is that true?</p>
    <p>I think its just bc i have rbf or bc its the way i talk to them?
        whats wrong with the way i talk? is it too loud? or too direct?
        im a singer so im naturally loud but i can also be soft spoken when im comfortable with the person.
        But i have few loyal friends that can prove my first impression is wrong
        i have 2 loyal friends from elementary, 2 from highschool and 3 here now in college.
        they say im a good listener and a trustworthy person, i guess thats the real me
        im a really good person when you get to know me</p>
