        <h4>Why I started BloomStudy Hime</h4>
        <p>
          “BloomStudy Hime started with a simple idea: studying doesn’t have to feel stressful or dull. As a student myself,
          I often struggled with procrastination, burnout, and endless distractions. I wanted a place where learning could feel lighter—like growth,
          not pressure. That’s why I created this site: to share strategies, tools, and inspiration that help students not just survive school, but
          truly bloom in their own learning journey.”
