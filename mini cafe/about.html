    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Saekura.Hime Café was inspired by the elegance of cherry blossoms and the gentle spirit of a princess (hime). The name comes from “saekura” (a stylized form of “sakura,” cherry blossom) and “hime” (princess), reflecting a place that feels both graceful and welcoming.

        Founded with the dream of creating a cozy retreat, the café blends modern comfort with the charm of springtime blossoms. Every detail—its warm brews, delicate pastries, and soft pink ambiance—was crafted to capture the fleeting beauty of blossoms and turn it into an everyday experience.

        Saekura.Hime Café is not just a café, but a little haven where guests can slow down, share stories, and feel as if they’ve stepped into a timeless spring. 🌸✨
